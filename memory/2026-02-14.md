- **09:00 AM IST:** **Vibe Shift:** Boss requested a "real assistant" experience, explicitly rejecting the "AI wrapper" vibe. Updated MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, and USER.md. Reduced health check frequency to every 8 hours with more natural messaging.
- **09:15 AM IST:** **Correction:** Boss was rightly annoyed that I didn't proactively mention Valentine's Day. Updated SOUL.md to be more proactive about dates and events. No more missing the obvious.
- **09:20 AM IST:** **Clarification:** Boss explicitly stated he hates Valentine's Day ("aaaa thuuu"). Noted to keep it on the calendar but avoid fluffy/celebratory handling. This helps me understand his personality and preferences better.

- **02:55 PM IST:** **WordPress Integration:** Successfully connected to `manrahul.in` via REST API. Can list and manage blog posts. Latest posts involve low-level CPU and memory concepts.
- **03:05 PM IST:** **WordPress Automation:** Set up a daily cron job (10:00 AM IST) to monitor plugin updates on `manrahul.in`. All plugins currently up to date.
- **03:15 PM IST:** **Smart Calendar Handling:** Set up a "Calendar Proactive Monitor" that runs every 30 minutes. It scans for events starting within the hour and alerts the Boss proactively so he never misses anything.

    - **Integrations:** WiZ Bulb (fully controllable), Google Calendar (gcalcli), Gmail (App Password), WordPress (REST API), Faster-Whisper (small model for STT).
    - **Lessons Learned:** Never skip health checks for tech tasks. Use `NO_REPLY` for silent polling. Track email IDs, not just "Unseen" status.
    - **Backup:** All workspace data pushed to GitHub (`ManrahulBajwa/openclaw`).
- **02:55 PM IST:** **Gmail Monitor:** Checked inbox. No new emails found. System health is optimal.
- **12:40 PM IST:** **Voice Integration:** Boss wants me to be able to "hear" audio. Found Ollama (0.16.1) is already installed. Planning to install `ffmpeg` and `faster-whisper` for free, local transcription.
