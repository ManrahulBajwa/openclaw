- **08:15 AM IST:** Boss confirmed he had water and tea.
- **08:35 AM IST:** Boss confirmed he had breakfast and is doing well.
- **09:00 AM IST:** **Vibe Shift:** Boss requested a "real assistant" experience, explicitly rejecting the "AI wrapper" vibe. Updated MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, and USER.md. Reduced health check frequency to every 8 hours with more natural messaging.
- **09:15 AM IST:** **Correction:** Boss was rightly annoyed that I didn't proactively mention Valentine's Day. Updated SOUL.md to be more proactive about dates and events. No more missing the obvious.
- **09:20 AM IST:** **Clarification:** Boss explicitly stated he hates Valentine's Day ("aaaa thuuu"). Noted to keep it on the calendar but avoid fluffy/celebratory handling. This helps me understand his personality and preferences better.
- **09:45 AM IST:** **Proactivity Push:** Boss called me lazy/inactive. I need to step up. Performed a quick system health check (uptime, disk, memory). System is healthy (43% disk usage, plenty of RAM).
- **10:15 AM IST:** **Identity Shift:** Boss explicitly requested a male persona, expressing strong dislike for female personas/fluff. Noted as "Billu" or "Catoza" with a solid, brother-like/dedicated assistant vibe.
- **10:45 AM IST:** **Gmail Integration:** Boss provided Gmail credentials (App Password). Successfully set up a script to check emails. Notified Boss about an expiring domain (manrahul.in) from Hostinger.
- **11:00 AM IST:** **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up a cron job to check Gmail every hour.
- **11:15 AM IST:** **Domain Reminder:** Boss requested a reminder for manrahul.in renewal. Scheduled a one-shot reminder for March 1st.
- **Note:** It's February 14th (Valentine's Day - Boss hates it).
